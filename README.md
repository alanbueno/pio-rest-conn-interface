## üìö Documentation

<p>This module makes use of <a aria-label="platformio" href="https://platformio.org/">platformio</a> to leverage the awesome connection features of the ESP family boards, it's been tested with the <a aria-label="esp32" href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32">Esp32</a> but can definitely be expanded to other models over time.</p>

- [:hammer_and_wrench: Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [üöÄ API Reference](#-api-reference)

---

## Getting Started

<p>To run this project and start interacting with your board, you'll have to setup <a aria-label="platformio" href="https://platformio.org/install/integration">platformio accordingly to your IDE</a> of choice.

Once that's done, grab your <a aria-label="esp32" href="https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32">board with a Esp32-MCU</a>, plug it in and make sure it shows up on your PlatformIO > Devices section.

Important to note that this project is pre-set with the `esp32doit-devkit-v1` board setting in the [platformio.ini](platformio.ini#L15), which is the board we've been testing it with. If you're using a different board, make sure to find it on the PlatformIO > Board Explorer, and replace `esp32doit-devkit-v1` with the PlatformIO board name matching yours.

</p>

## üöÄ API Reference

The endpoints exposed once you've done a successful build and uploaded your code to the board are dynamic and set based on the Network Mode the board is currently running, that means:

\* <PRE_SET_DNS_DOMAIN_NAME> = `DOMAIN_NAME` pre set on [NetworkManager.cpp](src/LocalWebServer/NetworkManager.cpp#L8)

\* <AP_SSID> = name for the AP network that the board creates, pre set on [NetworkManager.cpp](src/LocalWebServer/NetworkManager.cpp#L7)

- AP mode - Access Point network mode (local net from board):

  - you should be connected to the `AP_SSID` wifi network

  - `GET` - http://<PRE_SET_DNS_DOMAIN_NAME>/ap/ping

    Response `200 Ok`:

    ```
    {
      "message": "pong"
    }
    ```

  - `POST` - http://<PRE_SET_DNS_DOMAIN_NAME>/ap/switch-connection-to/sta

    Payload:

    ```
    {
      "ssid": "Your-SSID-to-connect-to",
      "password": "the-password-for-it"
    }
    ```

    Response `200 Ok`:

    ```
    {
      "ssid": "Your-SSID-to-connect-to",
      "ip": "192.168.1.124", // this will change according to your network
      "message": "Started Sta mode"
    }
    ```

  - `POST` - http://<PRE_SET_DNS_DOMAIN_NAME>/sta/switch-connection-to/ap

    `Fallback route (reverse mode), in case of redundant attempts of connection, when the mode's already up but the client's still trying to enable it`

    Payload: no payload

    Response `409 Conflict`:

    ```
    {
      "message": "you're trying to enable the current active mode, please check"
    }
    ```

```
Note: AP is the mode the board will automatically switch to if:
  - it doesn't have SSID/Password already stored in flash (persistent over resets or power off) to connect to;
  - tried connecting but failed;
  - connected, but eventually the connection provider's offline and the connection was lost;
```

\* <BOARD_IP_ADDRESS> = the ip that the board assumes after successfully connecting to a network provider (e.g. wifi router), it's logged to the Serial Monitor and can be actively sent from the board to any storage system, e.g. remote databse, IoT info broker, ...

- STA mode - Station network mode (internet):

  - you should be connected to the same wifi network as the board successfully did

  - `GET` - http://<BOARD_IP_ADDRESS>/sta/ping

    Response `200 Ok`:

    ```
    {
      "message": "pong"
    }
    ```

  - `POST` - http://<BOARD_IP_ADDRESS>/sta/switch-connection-to/ap

    Payload: no payload

    Response `200 Ok`:

    ```
    {
      "message": "Ap mode set successfully!"
    }
    ```

  - `POST` - http://<BOARD_IP_ADDRESS>/ap/switch-connection-to/sta

    `Fallback route (reverse mode), in case of redundant attempts of connection, when the mode's already up but the client's still trying to enable it`

    Payload: both, with or without payload will provide the same response

    Response `409 Conflict`:

    ```
    {
      "message": "you're trying to enable the current active mode, please check"
    }
    ```

## üèÖ Features

- Multi-task implementation using two cores to execute connection health-check loop;
- DNS server while in Ap mode, so the client can call a conventioned url instead of an ip;
- Fallback routes (reverse mode), in case of redundant attempts of connection, when the mode's already up but the client's still trying to enable it;
- Progressive Retry Mechanism, first reconnection attempt to the network provider after N seconds `RECONNECTION_INTERVAL`, then 2 \* N seconds, 3 \* N seconds, ... all the way to the `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`;
- Optional remote logging placeholder at `Utils.cpp`;
